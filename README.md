# LibTXNDCPy
A Python library and some C# wrappers for generating the XML format required by USGS's National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation Program's (NGGDPP) "National Digital Catalog" of geological sample materials.

One of the difficulties faced by state geological surveys participating in the National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation Program is the need to submit metadata back to USGS's National Digital Catalog (NDC) in a particular XML schema.  XML can be difficult to generate, as the code required to do so programmatically is often complex and verbose.  LibTXNDCPy addresses this difficulty by providing a simple API for populating this XML format.

##Python Quick Start:
Install LibTXNDCPy:
```
pip install LibTXNDCPy
```

Use LibTXNDCPy in your code:
